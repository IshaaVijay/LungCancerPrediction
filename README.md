<H1>LUNG CANCER PREDICTION</H1>

Our research focused on developing a comprehensive approach for lung cancer prediction using CT scans and advanced machine learning techniques. We implemented various preprocessing methods, including SMOTE, CWA, and data augmentation, to address class imbalance, optimize class importance, and enhance dataset diversity. These techniques were integrated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to capture relevant features and make predictions based on the extracted information.

The SMOTE technique showed good performance, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes. The CWA technique further improved the results, with even higher precision, recall, and F1-scores, indicating its effectiveness in lung cancer prediction. Data augmentation also demonstrated favorable performance, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the model. 
However, the LSTM model did not perform as well as expected, with lower precision, recall, and F1scores across the three classes. This suggests that further improvements or alternative approaches are needed to enhance its predictive capabilities for lung cancer detection. 
During the testing phase, the model's performance on 10 CT scans showed positive results, accurately predicting most cases across different classes. This highlights the model's potential to assist in the accurate identification and classification of lung cancer cases. 
Overall, our research highlights the importance of preprocessing techniques and the integration of advanced machine learning models, such as CNN, in improving lung cancer prediction using CT scans. The findings emphasize the need for continuous refinement and exploration of innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of lung cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and personalized treatment strategies in the field of healthcare.
